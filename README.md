# Bombachat
Bombachat uses customtkinter, socket, and threading using python in pycharm.
This is a stupid project i made yesterday (16/05/2025) using chatgpt because im an lazy fuck :,)
To make multiple client windows just copy the "Client" file and renaming it.
If you want new users to be accepted in bombachat enter the code in VScode or Pycharm and change the VALID_USERS dictionary.
To change dictionaries you need to add a key and the value it contains, like for example:
"Ferenc":"17441566"
"Bombabot":"bot"
and so on.
You need to install customtkinter using "pip install customtkinter"
Have fun using my trashpile of a project, i promise ill study the code and make it better :,)
